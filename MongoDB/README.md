# Understanding Database Types: Relational vs NoSQL üöÄ

## Introduction to Database Types:

### Relational Database (RDBMS)
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is the most traditional and widely used type of database. Proposed by E.F. Codd, it has these key characteristics:
- Stores data in tables (rows and columns)
- Each row represents a record
- Data is structured and organized
- Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Perfect for applications where data structure is consistent

### NoSQL Database
NoSQL (Non-SQL or Not Only SQL) databases are modern databases designed for specific data models. Key characteristics include:
- Doesn't use traditional table structure
- Flexible data organization
- Built for large-scale data handling
- Supports various data formats
- Ideal for rapidly changing data structures

## Detailed Comparison

### üìä Data Handling

# NoSQL Cloud Database Services üíª

#### NoSQL Cloud Database Services are cloud-based database services that provide scalable, high-performance, and cost-effective solutions for storing and retrieving data.

## Some popular NoSQL Cloud Database Services include:
- Amazon DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
- Google Cloud Datastore: A NoSQL document database service that is fully managed and offers automatic scaling, high availability, and low latency.
- Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB: A globally distributed, multi-model database service that provides high availability, low latency, and flexible data modeling.
- MongoDB Atlas: A fully managed global cloud database service for MongoDB that provides automated backups, advanced security, and easy scalability.

#### A NoSQL Cloud Database Services is a database that provides a means that helps to store and retrieve data is a NoSQL database. The term non-relational/non-SQL is initially referred to as NoSQL. Big data and web applications are some of its application that uses NoSQL databases in real-time and their utilization to boost with time. Sometimes, NoSQL databases are referred to as ‚ÄòNot only SQL‚Äô because query languages related to SQL are also supported. Better command over accessibility, less difficult level scaling to bunches of devices, and design simplicity are included in a NoSQL database.

### Types of NoSQL databases:
- Column-based
- Key-value store
- Graph databases
- Document-Based

## Difference between NoSQL Databases and SQL Databases:
- NoSQL database schema is flexible while SQL database schema is rigid.
- In NoSQL databases, queries are more immediate than SQL databases.
- NoSQL databases are non-relational while SQL databases are relational.
- NoSQL Examples -HBase, Bigtable.
- SQL Examples- Sybase, Access, Oracle, and MySQL.

# Understanding JSON and BSON: ‚úÖ

**JSON is a widely used data interchange format popular across many applications and technology stacks. BSON, the binary representation of JSON, is primarily used internally by MongoDB for efficient storage and data traversal.**

## What is JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular way to format data that's easy for both humans and computers to read. It's used everywhere in modern programming, from web APIs to configuration files.

### Key Features of JSON
- Uses human-readable text format
- Built on key-value pairs
- Easy to understand and work with
- Widely supported across programming languages

### Example of a JSON Object
```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Backus"
  },
  "contribs": [
    "Fortran",
    "ALGOL",
    "Backus-Naur Form",
    "FP"
  ],
  "awards": [
    {
      "award": "W.W. McDowell Award",
      "year": 1967,
      "by": "IEEE Computer Society"
    },
    {
      "award": "Draper Prize",
      "year": 1993,
      "by": "National Academy of Engineering"
    }
  ]
}
```

### JSON Structure Basics
- Curly braces `{}` define objects
- Square brackets `[]` define arrays
- Data is written as `"key": value` pairs
- Pairs are separated by commas
- Values must be one of these types:
  - Strings (in double quotes)
  - Numbers
  - Objects
  - Arrays
  - Boolean (true/false)
  - null

### Common Uses for JSON
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
- Configuration files
- Log messages
- Database storage

## What is BSON?
BSON (Binary JSON) is a special binary format that MongoDB uses to store data. Think of it as JSON's more efficient cousin, designed specifically for databases.

### Why MongoDB Uses BSON
MongoDB chose to use BSON because it needed something that was:
1. Fast to process
2. Easy to traverse (move through the data)
3. More feature-rich than JSON

### BSON Example
Here's how a simple JSON object looks in BSON format:

```
{"hello": "world"} ‚Üí

\x16\x00\x00\x00           // total document size
\x02                       // 0x02 = type String
hello\x00                  // field name
\x06\x00\x00\x00world\x00  // field value
\x00                       // 0x00 = type EOO ('end of object')
```

## JSON vs BSON Comparison

| Feature | JSON | BSON |
|---------|------|------|
| Encoding | UTF-8 text strings | Binary format |
| Data Types | Limited to:<br>‚Ä¢ Strings<br>‚Ä¢ Numbers<br>‚Ä¢ Booleans<br>‚Ä¢ Arrays<br>‚Ä¢ Objects<br>‚Ä¢ null | More extensive, including:<br>‚Ä¢ All JSON types<br>‚Ä¢ Dates<br>‚Ä¢ Binary data<br>‚Ä¢ Different types of numbers (integer, float, long, decimal128) |
| Readability | Both human and machine readable | Machine readable only |                                                                                                   |

## How MongoDB Uses JSON and BSON

### The Process Flow
1. Your application sends data in JSON format
2. MongoDB driver converts JSON to BSON
3. Data is stored in BSON format
4. When you request data:
   - BSON is converted back to JSON
   - JSON is sent to your application

### Benefits of Using BSON in MongoDB
1. **More Data Types**: Supports dates, binary data, and more
2. **Faster Processing**: Binary format makes data retrieval quicker
3. **Better Metadata**: Includes information about data length and types
4. **Efficient Storage**: Binary format often takes less space

## Working with BSON

### Converting Between BSON and JSON
You have several options:
- Use online JSON tools
- Use MongoDB's `bsondump` tool
- Let MongoDB drivers handle the conversion automatically

### When to Care About BSON
- As a beginner, you usually don't need to work with BSON directly
- MongoDB handles the JSON-to-BSON conversion automatically
- Focus on working with JSON in your applications
- The BSON conversion happens behind the scenes

## Summary
- JSON is the format you'll work with in your code
- BSON is how MongoDB stores that data internally
- You write and receive JSON, MongoDB handles the BSON conversion
- BSON makes MongoDB faster and more powerful while keeping JSON's ease of use

### Starting MongoDB

1. **Start the Server**:
```bash
# Create data directory first
mkdir C:\data\db

# Start MongoDB server
mongod
```
> üí° Default port is 27017

2. **Start the Client**:
```bash
mongo
```

## Basic Commands üíª

### Database Commands
```javascript
// Show all databases
show dbs

// Switch to a database
use <database_name>

// Show collections in current database
show collections
```

### Creating and Importing Data

1. **Create Collection**:
```javascript
db.createCollection("collection_name", {
    size: value,
    capped: boolean,
    max: value
})
```

2. **Import Data**:
```bash
mongoimport --jsonArray --db test --collection employee_data < path/to/file.json
```

## Querying Data

### Basic Query Methods
```javascript
// Count documents
db.collection.count()

// Find all documents
db.collection.find()

// Find one document
db.collection.findOne()

// Find with index (get 7th document)
db.collection.find()[6]  // indexing starts at 0
```

### Query Examples

1. **Count by Condition**:
```javascript
// Count employees in specific company
db.employee_data.find({ company: "GEEKS FOR GEEKS" }).count()
```

2. **Find by Name**:
```javascript
// Find all employees named "Sandeep Jain"
db.employee_data.find({ name: "Sandeep Jain" })
```

3. **Projection** (Select Specific Fields):
```javascript
// Show specific fields (exclude _id)
db.employee_data.find(
    { name: "Harshit Gupta" },
    { _id: 0, age: 1, gender: 1, email: 1 }
)
```

4. **Query with Variables**:
```javascript
// Find all female employees
var femaleEmp = db.employee_data.find({ gender: "female" })
for (var i = 0; i < femaleEmp.count(); i++) {
    print(femaleEmp[i].name)
}

// Alternative using projection
db.employee_data.find(
    { gender: "female" },
    { _id: 0, name: 1 }
)
```

## Important Notes üìù

1. **The `_id` Field**:
   - Automatically added if not provided
   - 12-byte hexadecimal number
   - Ensures document uniqueness
   - Can be modified (not recommended)

2. **Projections**:
   - Use `1` to include a field
   - Use `0` to exclude a field
   - `_id` is included by default
   - Must explicitly set `_id: 0` to exclude it

## Tips for Beginners üí°

1. Always start `mongod` server before using `mongo` client
2. Use meaningful collection names
3. Practice with small datasets first
4. Remember that MongoDB is case-sensitive
5. Use the `help` command when stuck
